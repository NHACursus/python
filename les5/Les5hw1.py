print ("")                        # I added this to make it more readable in the terminal
waterijsjes = 10                  # Data type integer 
prijs = 0.50                      # Data type float  
totaal = 10 * 0.50                # multiply 10 * 0.50, since 'prijs' is of the data type float, 'totaal' also becomes of the data type float 
print (totaal)                    # float, print now needs Parenthesis because it needs to print numbers
print("")
