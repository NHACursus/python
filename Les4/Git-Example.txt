Open your homework inside visual studio code.

Open a terminal 
type git status

if all goes well you will get this message: 
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
Thats ok now you are sure this folder is not used by git

type git init
type git add .
type git commit -m "your commit"

Login on your git account https://github.com
Klik new 
Type the Repository name* as indicated in the lesson, I am using "Example".
scroll down and klik "Create respository"

Dont close the new page

somewhere halfway down the page you will see somthing like this

    â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/NHACursus/Example.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main   

copy each line separately in the terminal from visual studio code and press enter

Done!
